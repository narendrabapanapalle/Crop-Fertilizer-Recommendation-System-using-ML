# 🌾 Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview

Farmers often face challenges in selecting the right crop and fertilizer for their soil conditions, leading to lower yields and financial losses. Our **AI-powered Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation System** leverages **machine learning** to provide data-driven insights for optimizing agricultural productivity.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### 🚜 Farmers struggle to determine the best crop and fertilizer for their soil conditions, resulting in:

- **Inefficient farming** due to incorrect crop choices.  
- **Loss of resources** from poor decision-making.  
- **Lack of precision** in manual recommendations.

## 💡 Solution

### Our **AI-powered model** takes **Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall** as inputs and predicts the most suitable crop for cultivation.

#### 🔹 Example Input:

```bash
N = 90, P = 42, K = 43
Temperature = 20°C, Humidity = 82%
pH = 6.1, Rainfall = 202 mm
```

#### 🔹 Predicted Output:

```bash
Recommended Crop → Rice 🌾
```
